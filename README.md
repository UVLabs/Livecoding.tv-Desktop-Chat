# Livecoding.tv-Desktop-Chat
A wrapper for livecoding.tv chat. Works great for users with 1 monitor.

#Reason:

The livecoding.tv popout chat for your browser still gets hidden if you're coding on your desktop and only have 1 monitor. This wrapper is an "always on top window". It will always be ontop of your IDE or text editor unless they themselves are maybe set to "always on top".

#Required:

.Net Framework v4.5 or higher.

#eWebBrowser

This is where the magic happens, original code for the eWebBrowser was found on Youtube. Readme will be updated with credit once proper information about it is acquired.
